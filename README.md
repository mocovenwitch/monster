### Config Tags

### Config Authors

### Deploy

Do not let Github generate Website for you, because the theme contains its own `_plugins`. 

So, you need to choose:

#### Option One - for user/orgnization Website

1. maintain theme source in repoA
2. deploy it in repo username.github.io with plain HTML/CSS/JS (results in _site)

#### Option Two - for project Website

1. maintain theme souce code in branch master
2. deploy it in branch [gh-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/)

Remember to add ***.nojekyll*** in branch to let Github know ***DONOT BUILD***.
